## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function in JavaScript is a package of reusable code that you can use later in your program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The parts of a function are the `function` keyword, optional function name, a comma-separated list of parameters surrounded by `()`, the start of the function's code block indicated by `{`, an optional `return` statement, and the end of the function's code block indicated by `}`.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call is shown by writing the name of the function followed by `()`.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The difference between a function `call` and a function `definition` when compared side-by-side is that the definition has more parts than the call.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  The difference between a `parameter` and an `argument` is that a `parameter` is a placeholder whose value isn't currently known until we call the function. The `argument` is the value that we actually want to pass into our function and run. Once we call our function, the parameter takes on the `argument's` value.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function `parameters` are useful, because they can be anything we want because they are placeholders.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The two effects a `return` statement has on the behavior of a function are:
  *Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  *Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  The syntax for defining an arrow function is to declare a variable followed by the assignment operator, comma-separated parameters enclosed in `()`, then an `=>`, next the opening of the function's code block indicated by `{`, an optional return statement. and finally the end of the function's code block indicated by `}`.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces there is no return statement, and the code block consists of only one line of code.
