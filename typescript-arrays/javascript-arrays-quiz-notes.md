Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are arrays used for?
  Arrays are used for storing multiple values in a single variable.

- Describe array literal notation.
  Array Literal notation is used 95% of the time when using arrays. You declare a variable followed by the variable name, the assignment operator (`=`), the values being stored which are separated by commas inside of brackets (`[]`).

- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?
  Arrays are different from "plain" objects, because objects store data in key/value pairs, while arrays don't. Also, objects can be used to store larger amounts of data than arrays. Arrays are iterable, while objects aren't.

- What number represents the first index of an array?
  The number that represents the first index of an array is `0`.

- What is the `length` property of an array?
  The `length` property of an array stores the number of items currently in the array.

- How do you calculate the last index of an array?
  To calculate the last index of an array, you find the length of the array and subtract 1.
