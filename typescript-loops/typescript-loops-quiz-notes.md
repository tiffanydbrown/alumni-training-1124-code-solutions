## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to manipulate data.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop is to provide a condition that will allow the loop to run as long as the condition is true.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Iteration in the context of loops means that the loop will run through one "loop" (carry out the instruction once).

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The **condition** expression of a `while` loop gets evaluated after the variable index is created.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The **initialization** expression of a `for` loop gets evaluated only once at the beginning.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The **condition** expression of a `for` loop gets evaluate once before every iteration to check if the condition is still true.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The **final** expression of a `for` loop gets evaluated third after each iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  Besides a `return` statement, the `break` keyword can exit a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates tto `false`.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The `++` increment operator will cause the loop to move forward.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You can iterate through the keys of an object using the `For In Loop`.
